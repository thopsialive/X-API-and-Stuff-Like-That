# X-API-and-Stuff-Like-That

A dashboard that tracks my X platform follower stats using APIs and GitHub Actions. A big thanks to Hashnode and Karol Horosin for the sharing this step-by-step tutorial.

## What are we building?

There will be a few pieces of software to write/configure:

- The code for fetching the data from X
- A script saving the data somewhere (in this case in the JSON file in GitHub repository)
- Schedule to run the code periodically - every day at a given time
- Dashboard to present the data (simple single HTML file using chart.js)
- GitHub Pages to host the dashboard
